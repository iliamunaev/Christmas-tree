# Christmas-tree
### I track my progress in programming by growing a Christmas tree every year.

I decided to set up a small tradition for myself, which will help me stay motivated and bring fun to my life. One year later, I'll look back to the past and say, "Yeah, man, this year was not a piece of shit. Now you're on the next level!"
